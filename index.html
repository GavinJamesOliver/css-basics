        <h2 class="header">What is a Treaty:</h2>

        <p>
          A treaty is a formal agreement between nations. The treaty establishes
          the responsibilities of each nation for dealing with each other and is
          legally binding. In the case of the numbered treaties in Canada
          between the Canadian government and the Indigenous peoples. The
          numbered treaties of Canada provided the framework for how the
          Indigenous and t he Canadian government would live together and share
          the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a huge difference between how the Indigenous saw the
          treaties and how the government did. For the Indigenous a treaty meant
          to bring things together and sacred promises. They saw the treaty as a
          way to build relationships and share the land. This contrasts with the
          Canadian government who used words like surrendered or gave up. To
          them the treaties were a way to make the Indigenous give up their
          land.

        <h2 class="header">Treaty 2:</h2>
        <p>
          Treaty 2 was signed shortly after Treaty 1. Signed in August 1871 in
          Manitoba, the land of Treaty 2 extends North and west of the Treaty 1
          territory and is three times the size of Manitoba at the time. The
          treaty contains 21,440,909 acres of land or roughly 86,768 square
          kilometers.

        <p>
          The Canadian Government aimed to take the Indigenous peoples land and
          assimilate them and their culture into European society. Indigenous
          people were concerned for their lands and traditional ways and wanted
          to secure their future by forming a good relationship with the
          Canadian government.
